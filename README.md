## Tooling
The open source initiative to create a JSON-based standard for developer tooling and workflows.

## What is the need ?
In past few years ecosystem of tools has exploded and we have a lot more tools and techniques to help us build softwares. But with this growth comes complexity and confusion to come with best tools to use. Productive developers in community surround themselves with powerful tools for different aspects of development an learn from each other's workflow. We believe that setting up a standard for developer tooling and workflows will allow developers to share it with fellows more effectively.

## What is tool?
A tool(programming tool or software development tool) is a computer program that software developers use to create, debug, maintain, or otherwise support other programs and applications

## What is developer workflow?
A developer or designer's workflow is set of tools he uses on his daily work.

## Tooling and Workflows
Tools out there and tools i use are two different things. Tooling is more about tools available out there while workflows is tools you use and you experience about them.
